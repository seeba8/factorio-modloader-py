# Factorio Modloader

I've started to play modded (https://www.factorio.com)[Factorio], so thought I'd look for an easy way to decide which mods to use before booting the game. 
If you do it ingame, you have to launch the game, enable or disable mods, and reboot.

This can be semi-automated I think.
